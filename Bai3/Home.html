    <span style="color: red;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span><span>After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</span>
    <p>I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
